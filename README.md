# sd-notes-tab
This is an extremely simple stable-diffusion-webui notes extension. It adds an extra 'notes' tab to your A1111 installation, letting you permanently store whatever important notes you want to keep.

# Installation

Install directly from the Extensions tab.

Alternatively, go to "Install from URL", then paste 'https://github.com/DocWizard/sd-notes-tab' into the URL field. Confirm with Install, then restart the WebUI.

# Usage

Simply navigate to the Notes tab at the top of your A1111 UI.

Your notes are saved automatically as soon as the textbox loses focus. They are stored in the extension's main directory (typically ./extensions/sd-notes-tab/)

# Disclaimer

I am not a dev. This extension was written with the assistance of an LLM. If you have any ideas on how to improve it - let me know, and I'll do my best. Better yet, make a PR :)
